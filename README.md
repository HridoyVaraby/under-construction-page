## Customization Options

### Change Countdown Date

In `script.js`, modify:

// Set the date we're counting down to (30 days from now)
const countDownDate = new Date();
countDownDate.setDate(countDownDate.getDate() + 30);
```

Replace with a specific date:

```javascript
// Set specific launch date
const countDownDate = new Date("June 1, 2025 00:00:00").getTime();
```

### Change Colors

Main gradient colors can be found in `styles.css`:

```css
.highlight::after {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #5e72eb 0%, #ff77eb 100%);
}
```

Replace the hex codes with your brand colors.

### Replace Background Image

Simply replace `bg-abstract.png` with your own image of the same name, or update the image reference in `styles.css`:

}
